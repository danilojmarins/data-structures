// There are two types of data structures: Physical and Logical

// Physical: Arrays, Linked Lists and other variations that
// combines both. They are physical because it defines how
// the data is allocated physically. Arrays are supported
// natively in most languages. It stores data in a container
// with fixed size, in a continuous way. Arrays can be created
// in stack or heap. Linked List is a dynamic data structure.
// It's a list of nodes, each node containing the data and the
// address to the next node. Doesn't need to be continuous
// addresess as arrays. Linked List is always created in heap.

// Logical: Stack, Queue, Trees, Graph, Hash Table. They are
// logical because deals with the way the data will be processed
// by the program. Stack and Queues are Linear. Trees and Graphs
// are Non-Linear. Hash Table is Tabular.
// Stack - LIFO. Queues - FIFO.
// Trees - Hierarchy. Graphs - Relation of nodes.
// Logical data structures are implemented using physical
// data structures.
