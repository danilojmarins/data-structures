// Array is a collection of elements with similar data types
// grouped in one sequence of addresses, the memory allocation
// is contiguous. Normal variables are called scalar variables
// and arrays are called vector variables. Each element of
// an array can be accessed by its index. Arrays are supported
// natively by every high level programming language.

int main()

    int x = 10; // 4 bytes are reserved in memory to store x

    int A[5]; // 4 * 5 bytes are reserved in memory to store A
